# Food Finder
A React Native mobile app which retrieves and displays restaurant information to help users decide where to eat.

# Start
```
npm install
npm start
```

# Tools Used
- `Node.js` - An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
- `npm` - A package manager for JavaScript
- `expo` - A tool to help create a React Native Project

# TODO:
- Restyling of the Login page (potentially separate the food login from the Job login)
    - Potentially use this colour palette? https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1294 
- Refactoring to have the Review, Swipe, and Map screens inherit from a parent class.
- Look into using Redux for storing information.
- Move Yelp auth to an environment file (there may be no simple way to do this with React Native)
- Allow searches to be customisable by user input.

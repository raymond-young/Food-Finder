# TODO:
- Restyling of the Login page (potentially separate the food login from the Job login)
    - Potentially use this colour palette? https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1294 
- Change any stray references to 'Job' to 'Restaurant' or 'Food' where appropriate.
- Refactoring to have the Review, Swipe, and Map screens inherit from a parent class.
- Look into using Redux for storing information.
- Move Yelp auth to an environment file.
